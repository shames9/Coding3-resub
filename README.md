## Project Intrroduction
The aim of this project is to explore the effect on the image style migration effect by adjusting the frame parameters and training times of the VGG19 model, and by using a different style of CONTENT IMAGE and the same style of STYLE IMAGE as another set of control groups with the same frame parameter adjustments and training times adjustments. I design a series of experiments using different structural parameters and training times of the VGG19 model for the image style migration task, and compare the quality and effectiveness of the generated images between different combinations of experiments. The experimental results are analysed to provide insights into methods and techniques for optimising deep learning model parameters and training strategies.
